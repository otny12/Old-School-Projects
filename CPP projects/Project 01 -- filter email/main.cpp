/*
  * Program: Spam filter (project 01)
  * Course: UIC CS 251
  * Programmer: Tony Lau
  * Professor: Reckinger
  * 
  * This Program takes input from a txt of spam emails with the expected format:
  * Domain:username ie.(aaa.com:user)
  * if a username is "*" any username will be accepted
  * 
  * This program will also take the input of a emails txt in the format:
  * Inbox# emailAddress subjectLine ie.(9 jhummel2@uic.edu Question about grading...)
  * 
  * commands taken by this program include:
  * load "exampleSpamList.txt"
  * display
  * check "exampleEmailAddress"
  * filter "exampleEmailInbox.txt" "exampleOutput.txt"
  *
